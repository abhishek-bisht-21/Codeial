Routes is the entry point of all the request from the browser . It is the dictionary
or the place from where you get to know which controller function or action needs
to be called.

Root Level Routes:
/home
/about
/contact

Set of URLs which have common part in them:
/users/profile
users/edit
users/create/

So if they all point to users then take me to another Route file
users.js where all these three(3) can be found. This is why we divide 
the routes.



That function which we called as controller is actually a action That
we want to take place for that particular route . SO group of actions
together is called as controller. Many actions in one single folder.
When we are developing our project on a large scale then controller is
a set of actions.


STEPS:
1) We created a router 1st
2) That router is now accessing the home_controller which has an exported function home
3) That home function is now accessible in route folder's index.js
4) Becoz we required the home_controller inside the index.js of route




Every time we create controllers action and we want it to be \
accesible we need to create a route for it.


Whenever a request is send from from the browser it first goes to index.js
file of app, where there is already marked that a certain router will be used
for any request which comes. Now after that any request which comes to home page 
goes to home_controller.home, any request to /users goes to users route, where further
mapping is done
